C++ with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) 

Description
This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises I have developed as part of my training in C++ with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) under EZTS. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in C++ programming, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving skills. The projects range from classic games to practical applications, showcasing a variety of data structures and algorithms.

Projects
1. Sudoku Game
A console-based Sudoku game that allows users to play and solve Sudoku puzzles. The game includes features for validating moves, checking the solution, and providing hints.

2. Banking System with ATM Simulation
A command-line interface (CLI) based banking system that simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. The project includes an ATM simulation that interacts with the banking system to perform transactions.

3. Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can compete against each other. The game includes input validation and a check for winning conditions.

4. Even/Odd Checker for Array Elements using Pointers
A program that checks whether the elements of a given array are even or odd. The implementation uses pointers to traverse and manipulate the array.

5. Student Grading System using Pointers
A student grading system that calculates and displays the grades of students based on their scores. The program uses pointers to access and manage student data.
